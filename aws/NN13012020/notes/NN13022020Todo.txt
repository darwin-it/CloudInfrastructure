Robert.jan.opschoor@nn.nl
Peter.doornbos@nn.nl
Leontine.dekker@nn-group.com
Niels.toussaint@nn.nl
Peter.vlug@nn.nl
. Check WIFI bij bcn 

v. Programma Opstellen en rond mailen na bevestiging van Jan Struik, zie draft
  kind reminder voor Jan Struik opstellen
. rename through the document Copy of fbVanillaAWSResources4NN.io
. 
v. Verplaats cloudberry practice naar bastionhost chapter
.. Edit the 4.1	Apply your changes to the vanilla design in draw.io section to reflect multiple VPC's


bucketname
.. keys
.. draw.io

. Ophogen service limits vpc's naar 10 en eip

Verify access rights with fbr@xs4all.nl 
. Admin rights for s3, etc
  Tunneling as an extra option - dus naar achteren verplaatsen
. Drawing for one vpc per attendee - certainy an option - see also https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr
  10.10.0.0/16
  10.10.0.0/24 (subnet)
  10.20.0.0/16
  10.20.0.0/24
. 5 VPC's per region - can increase certainly an option 
. eip's also 5 per region 
. Create Practice Cost Estimator right after RDS 
  V1 and V2
  . Add slides for Cost Estimator
   . EC2 
   . RDS 
   . S3 another cost estimator
   . VPC costs 
  https://calculator.aws/#/ calculator/estimator same thing
  https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html 
  
 
. Evaluate the drawing practice to draw all the components - at the beginning of each practice with draw.io after S3
  To reflect the naming and IP ranges - starting with
  The drawing must be like 
  2nd Practice after exploring the AWS console
v. Evaluate Chapter 5 - unique pvc's - correct drawings
  Share the VPC and the public Subnet
  rename all exsiting drawings aligned with the chapters
  Add NAT route tables for the priv subnets
. Revise practice around orangehrm - take the ami's below
  Diff between hvm en paravirtual as in virtualization)
  https://minops.com/blog/2014/07/paravirtual-vs-hvm-images/ long answer - hvm seems newer
. What the AMI of the original AMI orangehrm - with a local database
  bitnami-orangehrm-4.0-2-r08-linux-debian-9-x86_64-hvm-ebs ami-021af219e4b4630ac (admin/root)
  bitnami-orangehrm-3.3.2-3-r28-linux-ubuntu-14.04.3-x86_64-hvm-ebs ami-d8ae55b7 (ubuntu)
v. Add limits table to lab - different UI make a copy
  Wat are the limits per AWS resource add a table
  Are there max default 1920 vCPU per account
. Verstuur software request naar ict@bcn.nl prior tot de training - na antwoord van Rik
  Revise the S3 chapter
  . add bucket/folder/file/ (rename the file)
  . add Screen shots for draw-io in lab doc
. Summary slide what are take aways of this day
.. Huge amount of services - There are many choises to configure a specific services
.. Services are rarely alone - they are highly independent
.. Think (design) before you act (implement)
.. Very easy/fast to create service - but what about costs?
.. We are using the Console - but there are other (more efficient) ways to manage AWS services (CloudFormation, Terraform)

. Preso in stukken hakkken
  . Dan een slide deck over AWS Console, S3, VPC, EC2 en RDS en Cost Estimator (laatste toevoegen aks practice)
  . Plaatjes voor de practices - Draw.io Drawings??
. Pre-Req: eigen laptop dan extra software icw tunneling (as extra option)
  MobaXterm, CloudBerry, SQLDeveloper plus een plug-in welke is de laatste?
  dmv links te downloaden op eigen laptop dan wel (Windows BastionHost)
. Setup of accounts and the usage of multiple VPC's - not enough service limits
  50 ec2 instances per attendee: 5 instances 44 left (max 8 deelnemers when account is empty)
  max 5 VPC's per region
  see also https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html
  including the associated access rights


. add an iam practice only allowed to 

v. Testing of a 2nd vpc with the same CIDR's any ip conflicts? across vpc's? absolutely!
  Within a region you cannot have private subnets with exactly same CIDR's accross VPC's!
  You are blocked on the subnet cidr range - all within Frankfurt
  1st fbvpc; fbprivsnas1; 10.0.1.0/24; eu-central-1a 
  IP address: 10.0.1.204
  2nd fb2pvs; fb2privsn; 10.0.1.0/24; eu-west-1a
  10.0.1.204
  ->CIDR Address overlaps with existing Subnet CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24
  The following CIDR 10.0.2.0/24 does work
   What would be a different exercise?
  Whitin the same vpc per student
  . Create a single public subnet igw and NAT
  . creating seperate as route tables per student to allow outgoing internet trafic (max 200) (the NAT association)
  . Creating seperate private subnets (max 200) each with a different CIDR 10.0.2.0/24 with different 
    10.10.x.0;10.20.x.0;10.30.x.0 etc for each student
  . Creating seperate security groups (max 500)
  . Creating seperate instances each in their own subnet (max 20 per account cross region?)
  . Creating seperate loadbalancers (max 50)
  Other limits
  . 5000 network interfaces
  or Within different regions
  . vpc's with subnets with the same CIDR's
  . Instances with same private ip's - they do not conflict
  . risk that all not ami's are available
. Slide deck for the 1st day based on latest kpnfriducation
. Remove all 2nd day chapters (thus all chapters after CLI)

Subject 1st day: intro, AWS console, S3, VPC, BH, AS1, RDS
----------------------------------------------------------
2nd day subjects
. All unfinished subjects
. CLI
. 2nd As
. LB
. Resource groups
. EFS
. IAM - when required add before EFS
  No practices around IAM yet
  Add policy that only resources can be created within the Frankfurt region
Additional subjects
. Cost estimator
  for your windows, linux, LB, VPC, EFS
  
  CloudFormation vpc with private and public subnets and multiple security groups->
  to be created template based on existing resources - does not work with current portfolio - through cloudformer beta

See also https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-cloudformer.html
Step 1 Create a cloudformer template (default vpc or new vpc is not clear) - may take a while note that the cloudformer is still beta (04)
       AWS CloudFormer Beta - template creation prototype application. This tool allows you to create an AWS CloudFormation template
       You will use the cloudformer sample template 
       This will result in https://ec2-35-158-123-130.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com on a seperate instance 
	   This url is visible within the output tab when finished
       If you delete this instance you will also loose the capability to create the actual template
Step 2 Launching above url https://ec2-35-158-123-130.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com 
       Wizard like interface that allows you to pick your already created resources - except eni's?
       This will result in the actual template (json file) based upon the selections - the result json will be stored in S3
	   It did not show all all eni network interfaces? because step 1 was not complete?
Step 3 Running the actual template - in principle all resources will be created
       Note that were no selections like instance types for ec2 instances - all your resource naming were hardcoded?
	   The execution failed: 
	   The following resource(s) failed to create: [volumevol071cdbd95b3b1b1bb, 
	   volumevol048a5d385d7d8eef1, volumevol0fa1db01f185e4774, acl504eb13a, dopta99fbdc2, igw01e08344939dadcbd, s3awsbucketfb19092019,

       14:54:44 UTC+010 CREATE_FAILED	AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup dbsgdefault DBSecurityGroup is not supported in this region
	   2nd round - 
	   . choose only vpc like objects
	   . Change the naming fb into fb2 to circumvent naming conflicts
	   . upload the changed json
	   . rerun with modified json
	   2nd run failed as well
	   	The following resource(s) failed to create: [subnet09edf43135ad02130, subnet025b1df6e26093372, sgfb2secgrplb, subnet0b70464fa88d241a0,

		Exactly one of [NatGatewayId, GatewayId, NetworkInterfaceId, TransitGatewayId, InstanceId, EgressOnlyInternetGatewayId, 
		VpcPeeringConnectionId] must be specified and not empty
		Only create vpc, subnets and security groups with template
		remove igw, dhcpoptions, nat, eip and route tables (igw, nat and local) 
		Add eip, nat igw and route tables post
. How to add additional EBS storage in windows 
   called virtual hard disk (create/attach)
   requires a location ?? what about a drive letter

Questionnaire
-------------
1. Can you have the same local ip adress across multiple vpc's within the same tenant?
   Test noop
   v. Test a 2nd vpc with the same CIDR's any ip conflicts? across vpc's?
  You are blocked on the subnet cidr range - all within Frankfurt
  1st fbvpc; fbprivsnas1; 10.0.1.0/24; eu-central-1a
  2nd fb2pvs; fb2privsn; 10.0.1.0/24; eu-central-1a: 
  CIDR Address overlaps with existing Subnet CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24
  The following CIDR 10.0.2.0/24 does work
  or change to different region
2. Difference between an account and a user?
3. As a developer no access rights to iam
   what access rights do I require?
   no access right to generate keys within my security credentials
   Extended with efs, vpc, rds and S3 Full access rights
4. There is no recording of efs and instances within the AWS console??   
5. Does efs require a security group itself ??? may be not?? 

With CLI you require 
d.	Access key ID: AKIAJG7RI7YIPLFNZEBQ
e.	Secret Access key: 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
